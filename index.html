		[Verse 1]<br>
		I found a love for me<br>
		Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
		Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
		Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
		'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
		Not knowing what it was<br>
		I will not give you up this time<br>
		But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
		And in your eyes, you're holding mine<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		[Chorus]<br>
		Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
		Barefoot on the grass, listening into our favourite song<br>
		When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
		But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		[Verse 2]<br>
		Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
		She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
		I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
		To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
		We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
		Fighting against all odds<br>
		I know we'll be alright this time<br>
		Darling, just hold my hand<br>
		Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
		I see my future in your eyes<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		[Chorus 2]<br>
		Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
		Barefoot on the grass, listening into our favourite song<br>
		When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
		I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		[Instrumental]<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		[Chorus 3]
		Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
		Barefoot on the grass, listening into our favourite song<br>
		I have faith in what I see<br>
		Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
		And she looks perfect<br>
		I don't deserve this<br>
		You look perfect tonight<br>
