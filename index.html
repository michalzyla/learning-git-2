		[Verse 1]
		I found a love for me
		Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
		Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
		Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
		'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
		Not knowing what it was
		I will not give you up this time
		But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
		And in your eyes, you're holding mine	
	</p>
	<p>
		[Chorus]
		Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
		Barefoot on the grass, listening into our favourite song
		When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
		But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
